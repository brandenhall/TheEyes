            <h3>Behind the Eyes</h3>
            <p>There are five creatures that look out of the Eyes. Each has its own personality and rhythms. They have been there as long as the tree has held them inside. They have been watching you from the site. Now, by interacting with the Eyes you can tell the creatures how you feel and they converse with you at last, causing you to see yourself through a new lens.</p>
            <p>The creatures wake and sleep at regular intervals based on their personality. So while you might not see a particular creature when you're viewing the eyes, rest assurred they will wake up after a few minutes of rest.</p>

He wants you to go away so he can go back to sleep. Will you provoke the grump or will he hurt your feelings? After his fit he is so tired, he'll probably fall back asleep.

            <p>Each eye is made of aluminum plate that was drilled, shaped, and TIG welded. To shade each LED cluster there 63 aluminum tubes attached, using a specialized adhesive, to the front of each eye. The eyes are hung from the support structure using high strength monofilament fishing line.</p>
            <p>The steel support structure was custom designed and fabricated for this installation.</p>
