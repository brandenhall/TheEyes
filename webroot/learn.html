            <p>There are five creatures that look out of the Eyes. Each has their own personality and daily rhythms. By interacting with the Eyes you teach the creatures how you feel and they adjust their rhythms to try to match. </p>

The baby is happy and sweet except when it gets tired or when you leave. If the baby is unhappy it might start to cry! But when the baby smiles, it's eyes will express curiosity and lots of excitement with you.</p>

            <p>The Grannie knows that not much else matters but love. She focused on YOU because YOU are so special. The Grannie sends you a hug when she sees you and whenever you are down. She sees how you are connected to the big picture. She has the wisdom to know that as an individual your actions change the world.  Grannie knows that with a hug, the little things that trifle you will fade away.</p>
            <p>Grannie checks in with you to make sure you are OK.  Sometimes Grannie gets a little too personal. But can you blame her? She loves you!</p>
            <p>Grandma goes to bed early but wakes up and watches the word intermittently through the night, drifting off to sleep and then wakes again, taking naps and waking again. Once a day she gets together with other grandmas to talk about you. She is so proud of you!</p>

            <h3>The Grump</h3>
            <p>Watch out for the grump that lives in the tree. You may see him when you see eyes darting back and forth occasionally. He is sneaky and suspicious of why you have come to the park. He likes to be alone. He is sensitive. He doesn’t agree with anyone. He wants you to go away so he can go back to sleep.</p>
            <p>He gets madder the more people provoke him in what he considers his personal park. If you antagonize him you can get him to flame at the smallest things. His anger may cause him to have a fit! After his fit he is so tired, he'll probably fall back asleep. But you will want to keep waking him up because his eyes are so crazy to watch.</p>

            <p>The Raver is an awesome, fearless teen. Engaging with the Raver is like playing with a puppy. He’s fun, bouncy, quick, happy, impulsive, energetic and dramatic. And he wants everyone to unite and party, party, party!</p>
            <p>The Raver takes risks- he dares you to be silly, weird or crazy, just for fun-- just to see what you’d say. He stays up late. He likes to sleep in too. And when the Raver wakes up, someones eyes are sleepy and red until they refresh, and can party all night long again.</p>
